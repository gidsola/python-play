# Python Play

Welcome to the Python Play repository!  

This workspace is dedicated to experimenting with Python code and exploring various programming concepts using Huggingface and locally hosted models as well as other custom endpoint implements.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-play.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd python-play
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Note for Fast API
I have removed fast-api from the requirements.tx as it has a specific mention on how it should be installed.
 - install using the following cmd: ``` pip install "fastapi[standard]" ```
 - for more info see: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/#installation

## Getting Online
You can start the fastapi server by typing: ``` fastapi dev main.py ```

Happy coding!
